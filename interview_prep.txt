me:
    - 3rd year at UBC, major EE, minor commerce
    - I first chose EE bc interested in circuits
    - through course work and current co-op, I learned that I also really enjoy coding
    - and I want to pursue a career that combines those 2 interests
    - so I hope to take this opportunity to learn more skills relating to embedded systems
    - main career goal to work at a company that will allow me to grow my skills as much as possible
    - and further develop myself as a professional


why rivian:
    - Building electric vehicles that are capable, rugged, and fun
    - Designing technology that is sustainable and environmentally responsible
    - Encouraging exploration while reducing carbon emissions
    - Rivian is known for writing a huge portion of its software internally, rather than outsourcing it
    - hands on experience with embedded systems


come together (strength):
    - I really enjoy collaborating with others
    - I found that's one of the best ways for me to learn, from other people
    - having multiple perspectives really helps to fully understand a problem and find the optimal solution
    - or even how everyone has a slightly different way of doing things
    - I can learn from them and figure out what works best for me


ask why:
    - *find root causes to solve problems instead of surface level solutions


stay open (weakness):
    - a weakness I've been working on this year is my mindset towards mistakes
    - before, I would often be really hard on myself when I make a mistakes
    - but this kind of closed mindset wasn't really helping me learn
    - so I've been trying to improve by adopting more of a growth mindset
    - this being, if I make a mistake, it's okay as long as I fix the mistake ASAP
    - and take note of it so it doesn't happen again
    - doing this has really helped me learn more and open myself to more opportunities


zoom out:
    - *think of the bigger picture to find a good solution for everyone


over deliver:
    - current co-op, my position is mainly manufacturing and testing
    - but I wanted to optimize this opportunity by learning new skills
    - and contributing as much as I can during my term
    - so I took on multiple side projects to help improve processes or automate tedious tasks
    - recently I received logs from DC that conducted FW upgrades on devices
    - there were thousands of logs
    - and I was told to just pick a few at random to check that they all passed
    - this process wasn't ideal, so I wrote a python script to go through all the logs
    - and output an excel sheet with the information in all the logs
    - to thoroughly check that they all passed
    - doing this I actually found 10 devices that failed the FW upgrade
    - so now we can make sure no faulty devices would be sold


questions:
    - explain ISR question?
    - Ian also studied EE, was it difficult pursuing a more software related career?
    - what are projects you are currently working on, or planning to assign for the next co-op term?
    - how would training be conducted at the beginning of the term?
    - if I were to receive an offer, what would you recommend I learn or improve on before the start date?
    - when can I hear back about this position?
